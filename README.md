# Reaction to Alan Turing’s "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)

Alan Turing’s "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" revolutionized the study of artificial intelligence by asking, “Can machines think?” and introducing the Turing Test to evaluate intelligence through observable behavior. By focusing on functionality rather than abstract definitions, Turing shifted AI from philosophy to practical experimentation.

His anticipation of objections, such as claims that machines lack creativity or consciousness, highlights his deep insight into societal skepticism. Turing’s optimism about intelligent machines feels prophetic, as his ideas continue to shape AI research today.

This paper remains a foundational work, challenging us to rethink intelligence and the human-machine relationship.
